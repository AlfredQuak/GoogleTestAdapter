* enhancement: settings are now printed to test output if GTA is running in debug mode ([#60](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/60))
* enhancement: cleaned up log output a bit ([#62](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/62))
* enhancement: GTA can now also handle tests written with older versions of Google Test which do not print type and value parameter information when listing tests ([#68](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/68))
* enhancement: option *PATH extension* now supports placeholder *$(ExecutableDir)*
* bugfix: if listing of tests failed, GTA produces a warning now, and no further efforts are taken to parse SourceFileLocations ([#63](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/63), thanks to [Sergey Gomon](https://github.com/gomons) for example solution)
* bugfix: if a test crashed, but produced output immediately before the crash, that output would not end up in the test explorer ([#58](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/58))
* quality assurance: improved stability of end-to-end tests ([#61](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/61))
